# Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains implementations of several popular machine learning algorithms for dimensionality reduction, clustering, and classification. The algorithms included are:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- Hierarchical Clustering
- k-Means Clustering
- Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
